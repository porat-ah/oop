Assignment 1
============

Java implementation of an undirectional weighted graph.
-------------------------------------------------------

A java implementation of undirectional weighted graph, 
that implements the interface "weighted_graph".
The implementation uses a private class "Node" that implements the interface "node_info".

Java implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
--------------------------------------------

A java implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm , 
for finding the shortest path length between two nodes in an undirectional weighted graph.
this implementation implements the interface "weighted_graph_algorithms".
The implementation was ispired by  "Advanced Data Structures in Java" course on coursera,
made by The University of California San Diego.

Java implementation of BFS algorithm
------------------------------------

A java implementation of BFS Algorithm,
for finding if an undirectional graph is connected.
The implementation was ispired by the youtube video :
"Breadth First Search Algorithm | Shortest Path | Graph Theory"
made by "WilliamFiset".
